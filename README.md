# Firebase Studio - Ezi Languages

This is a Next.js starter project created in Firebase Studio, designed as a language learning platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command to install all the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    The project requires Firebase configuration keys to connect to your Firebase project.
    - Copy the example environment file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
    - Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the values for your Firebase project. You can find these in your Firebase project settings.

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    Once the installation and setup are complete, run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`.
